# true-hello-world
The "true" keyword was putted because i wanted to differ this repository (that is being created based on the github guides tutorial) from my first ever repository, that was created in a total crazy and undirected way.
Cool, i can edit this in any way possible, i can write a really long document that is a total...mess? I don`t know...
